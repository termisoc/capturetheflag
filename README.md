# Capture the Flag

_our real-world capture the flag game._

## Hacking on it

1. Fork it.
    - you'll likely want to pull down any changes, then run:
    - `python manage.py syncdb` to get the database working.
    - and then `python manage.py runserver` to get it working.
1. Make your changes.
1. Don't update the README, or any tags or version numbers (we'll do that.)
1. Send a pull request for your changes.
1. If they're accepted (which they most likely will be), it'll get pushed live.

## Found a bug?

1. Log it on the [project's issues page](http://github.com/termisoc/capturetheflag/issues).
    - explain how to reproduce it.
    - what it does / doesn't do.
    - but, just before check it's not already there!
1. Or, fix it!
    - this way, we'll love you more.
