# Capture the Flag

_our real-world capture the flag game._

## Hacking on it

1. Clone a copy: `git clone git@github.com:termisoc/capturetheflag.git CaptureTheFlag`.
1. Then run:
    - `python manage.py syncdb` to get the database working.
    - and then `python manage.py runserver` to get it working.
1. Make your changes.
1. Don't update the README, or any tags or version numbers (we'll do that.)
1. Push your changes back up.

Don't have commit access? Fork it, and send a pull request, and it'll get merged in.

## Found a bug?

1. Log it on the [project's issues page](http://github.com/termisoc/capturetheflag/issues).
    - explain how to reproduce it.
    - what it does / doesn't do.
    - but, just before check it's not already there!
1. Or, fix it!
    - this way, we'll love you more.
